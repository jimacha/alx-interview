# 0x06. Star Wars API Algorithm

## Description
This project, 0x06. Star Wars API Algorithm, is a JavaScript application that interacts with the Star Wars API. It allows users to access various data related to the Star Wars universe, including information about characters, planets, starships, vehicles, species, and films. The project demonstrates how to integrate with an external API using JavaScript and how to handle data retrieval and manipulation.

## Prerequisites
Before running this application, ensure you have the following installed:

1. **Node.js 10:** Install Node.js version 10 by running the following commands in your terminal:
   ```
   $ curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_10.x | sudo -E bash -
   $ sudo apt-get install -y nodejs
   ```

2. **Semi-Standard:** Install the semi-standard coding style globally using npm:
   ```
   $ sudo npm install semistandard --global
   ```

3. **Request Module:** Install the request module globally using npm:
   ```
   $ sudo npm install request --global
   ```
   
   Note: After installing the request module, export NODE_PATH to ensure it can be accessed globally:
   ```
   $ export NODE_PATH=/usr/lib/node_modules
   ```

## Installation
1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/0x06-star-wars-api.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd 0x06-star-wars-api`

## Usage
1. Open `index.html` in your preferred web browser.
2. Use the application interface to search for Star Wars data by selecting the appropriate category (characters, planets, starships, vehicles, species, or films) and entering relevant search terms.

## API Integration
The project utilizes the Star Wars API (https://swapi.dev/) to fetch data. The `script.js` file contains functions for making API requests and handling responses.
