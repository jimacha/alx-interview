# 0x03. Log Parsing

# Log Parsing Algorithm using Python

## Project Overview

This Python project implements a log parsing algorithm to process and analyze log files efficiently. This algorithm is designed to handle various log formats and extract relevant information for further analysis. Whether you're dealing with server logs, application logs, or any other type of log files, this tool can help you extract valuable insights from the data.

## Features

- **Log Format Agnostic:** This algorithm is designed to handle different log formats, making it versatile for various applications.
- **Customizable Parsing Rules:** Easily customize parsing rules to extract specific information from your log files.
- **Efficient Processing:** The algorithm is optimized for speed and efficiency, making it suitable for processing large log files.
- **Output Flexibility:** Extracted data can be formatted and exported in various ways, such as CSV, JSON, or database storage.
- **Error Handling:** Robust error handling ensures the algorithm can gracefully handle unexpected log file formats and errors.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following prerequisites installed on your system:

- Python 3.x: [Download Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd log-parsing-algorithm
   ```

3. Install dependencies (if any):

   ```bash
   pip install <dependency-name>
   ```

## Usage

To use the log parsing algorithm, follow these steps:

1. **Define Parsing Rules:** Modify the parsing rules in the `config.py` file to match the format of your log files. Specify the patterns, delimiters, or regular expressions to extract relevant information.

2. **Run the Algorithm:** Execute the `log_parser.py` script, passing the path to the log file as an argument.

   ```bash
   python log_parser.py /path/to/your/logfile.log
   ```

3. **Review Output:** The algorithm will process the log file according to the defined rules and display or export the extracted information as specified.

## Examples

### Example 1: Parsing Apache Access Logs

```python
# Sample parsing rule for Apache Access Logs in config.py
LOG_FORMAT = r'(?P<ip>.*?) - - \[(?P<timestamp>.*?)\] "(?P<request>.*?)" (?P<status>\d+)'

# Sample Apache Access Log entry
# 127.0.0.1 - - [18/Sep/2023:14:05:45 +0000] "GET /example-page HTTP/1.1" 200
```

### Example 2: Parsing CSV-formatted Logs

```python
# Sample parsing rule for CSV-formatted logs in config.py
LOG_FORMAT = r'(?P<timestamp>.*?),(?P<user>.*?),(?P<action>.*?),(?P<status>\d+)'

# Sample CSV log entry
# 2023-09-18 14:05:45,user123,login,200
```
