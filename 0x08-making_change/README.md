# Project Readme: 0x08. Making Change

## Overview

Welcome to the "0x08. Making Change" project! This project involves implementing algorithms in Python to solve problems related to making change.

## Project Description

In this project, you will be working on algorithms that deal with making change, a classic problem in computer science and mathematics. The main objective is to design Python algorithms to efficiently determine the minimum number of coins needed to make change for a given amount.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you are expected to:

1. **Understand the Making Change Problem:**
   - Grasp the concept of making change and the challenges associated with finding the optimal solution.

2. **Algorithm Design:**
   - Develop algorithms in Python to solve the making change problem efficiently.

3. **Dynamic Programming:**
   - Explore and apply dynamic programming concepts to improve the efficiency of your algorithms.

4. **Optimization:**
   - Optimize your Python code to ensure it runs efficiently for various input scenarios.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into modules, each addressing a specific aspect of the making change problem. The structure may include directories such as:

- **01_greedy_algorithm:** Implementation of a greedy algorithm for making change.
  
- **02_dynamic_programming:** Exploration of dynamic programming techniques to solve the making change problem more efficiently.

- **03_optimization_strategies:** Strategies for optimizing Python code to enhance performance.
